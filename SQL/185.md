# Intuition
Need to figure out top salaries of each department.
Once obtained I can inner join on that and what remains is the top salaries

# Approach
1. Create a query to grab top DISTINCT salaries from Employee table using Row_Number() function ordering by departmentId & salary.
2. Query that query and add where clause to only grab the top salaries.
3. Inner Join in department name
4. Inner Join sub query  


# Code
```mssql []
SELECT 
    d.name as Department, 
    e.name as Employee, 
    e.Salary
FROM
    Employee e
    JOIN 
        Department d
    ON
        e.departmentId = d.id
    
    JOIN
    (
        SELECT 
            departmentId, 
            salary 
        FROM (
            SELECT 
                *, 
                Row_Number() over (partition by departmentId ORDER BY departmentId, salary desc) salaryRank
            FROM(
                SELECT DISTINCT 
                    salary, 
                    departmentId 
                FROM 
                    Employee  
            ) salaryRanked 
        ) topSalaries where salaryRank <= 3
    ) ts 
    ON 
        ts.departmentId = e.departmentId 
    AND 
        ts.salary = e.salary
